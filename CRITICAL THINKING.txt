How to think critically

Here are steps you might take when using critical thinking for problem-solving at work:

- Identify a problem or issue.

- Create inferences on why the problem exists and how it can be solved.

- Collect information or data on the issue through research.

- Organize and sort data and findings.

- Develop and execute solutions.

- Analyze which solutions worked or didn’t work.

- Identify ways to improve the solution.
