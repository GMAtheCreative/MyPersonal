The term "grit" in the context of psychology and personal development was popularized by Angela Duckworth, a psychologist and researcher. She defines grit as the combination of passion and perseverance towards long-term goals. 

The choice of the word "grit" likely stems from its connotations of toughness, resilience, and determination.

It's a word that captures the essence of persistence and tenacity, making it a fitting term to describe this particular trait of character. Overall, the term "grit" effectively encapsulates the resilient and determined spirit that defines individuals who possess this quality.
